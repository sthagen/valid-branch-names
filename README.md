# valid-branch-names

Valid git(hub) branch names show case.

## Rationale

Encouraging an active and individual naming culture for branches / refs.

Neither `main` nor `master` are convincing names for refs,
In most cases I encountered this branch does **not** represent the **main** or **master** perspective.
At least not for developers, maintainers, and users alike.

The names of the default branches in the currently 2167 forks I actively maintain appear to be accidental, historic, or random.
A text label without any semantic connection to what is shown / checked out when no specific branch is requested.

Just because branches are "cheap" in git does not mean we have to use them for every use case or all the time.

For stable references we may choose between tags, platform release mechanisms, community wide packaging, and plain old static websites. 

## Valid Names

Some examples present in this repository:

- `!`
- `%`
- `+`
- `,`
- `0`
- `=/=`
- `_`
- `default`
- `dev`
- `develop`
- `future`
- `grow`
- `process`
- `random`
- `select`
- `trunc`

The above names are all serving their use cases well. 

## Status

Experimental.

**Note**: The default branch is `#`.
